    <h2>Caring Instructions</h2>
    <p class="instructions"> <!--add css information for formatting-->
      Caring well for a Maine Coon protects health, comfort, and behavior. Regular brushing prevents painful mats and reduces hairballs. 
      A balanced, portioned diet helps control weight and supports joints. Daily play and climbing options meet their curiosity and keep stress lower. 
      Fresh water and clean litter boxes support hygiene. Routine veterinary and dental checkups catch problems early, and some vets may recommend periodic heart screening for large breeds. 
      A few minutes of consistent care each day pays off in fewer surprises and a happier cat.
