        <p class="background">
          Meet the <i>gentle giants</i> of the cat world—<b>Maine Coon cats</b>, shaped by New England winters to be rugged yet affectionate. 
          Their dense, <b>water-resistant</b> coats, tufted ears, and sweeping plume tails are built for weather, but their hearts are built for people. 
          They shadow their humans from room to room, chatting in soft <i>chirps</i> and showing off playful intelligence. 
          Despite their size, they’re <b>calm, patient, and family-friendly</b>, fitting in well with kids and other pets when introduced thoughtfully. 
          If you want a companion that’s equal parts presence and tenderness, a <b>Maine Coon</b> makes every day feel a little bigger and a lot warmer.

        <h2>Temperament</h2>
        <p class="background">
          Maine Coons are <b>friendly</b>, <b>confident</b>, and <b>people-oriented</b>, often shadowing their favorite humans from room to room. 
          They “talk” with soft <i>chirps</i> and <i>trills</i> and love <b>interactive play</b> such as wand toys, fetch, and food puzzles. 
          Highly intelligent, they respond well to simple training and thrive with <b>daily engagement</b> and a predictable routine. 
          Their temperament is <b>gentle</b> and <b>patient</b>, making them a strong fit for homes with children or other pets when introductions are <i>slow</i> and <i>supervised</i>. 
          Offer climbing spaces, scratching posts, and regular enrichment to channel their <b>curious</b> energy into healthy activity, and you’ll have a devoted companion who is affectionate without being demanding.
